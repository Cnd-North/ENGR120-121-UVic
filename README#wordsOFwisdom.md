RobotC Code!

I will be posting all the coding on this repository as we go along. 

Should be good stuff.. defiantly comment and provide feedback if you're not sure about something or have a better way of doing something, that would be awesome!


If you just copy the code striaght up, thats totally cool... just please change the comments within, the last thing we need is TAs looking at code and seeing we all have the exact same comments.. #gameOver

I hope you find this helpful, and tell you're friends cause engineering is all about working together #causeWeAllDyingOfWork #overloaded




Keep it fresh!
